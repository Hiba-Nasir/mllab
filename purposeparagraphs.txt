K-Means is used for k-means is a technique for data clustering that may be used for unsupervised machine learning.
It is capable of classifying unlabeled data into a predetermined number of clusters based on similarities (k).
For example, if you have customer data, you might want to create sets of similar customers and then target each 
group with different types of marketing.

CNN is used forcomputer vision such as face recognition, image classification etc.
It is similar to the basic neural network. 
CNN also have learnable parameter like neural network i.e, weights, biases etc.

SVM is used for SVMs are used in applications like handwriting recognition, intrusion detection, 
face detection, email classification, gene classification, and in web pages. 
This is one of the reasons we use SVMs in machine learning. 
It can handle both classification and regression on linear and non-linear data.
